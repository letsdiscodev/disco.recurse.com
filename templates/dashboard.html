An error happened. Please contact [Greg Sadetsky](mailto:lepetitg@gmail.com).
{% endif %}

{% if found_api_key %}

**You're all set up!! Now...**

0. You'll need a project to deploy -- you can fork this [sample repo](https://github.com/letsdiscodev/example-flask-site/).
1. Run `disco github:apps:add` to connect your GitHub account.
2. Pick which repos you want to manage using disco (you can always change).
3. Finally, deploy a project to the community server:

`disco projects:add --github USER/REPO --name PROJECTNAME --domain EXAMPLE.COM`

- Replace all of the uppercase values:
  - the `USER/REPO` should be the GitHub repo you want to deploy (e.g. `johnsmith/hello`)
  - the `PROJECTNAME` can be any short name to identify your project
  - for the domain, you can use `ANYTHING.rcdis.co` (replacing ANYTHING, obviously). If you get an error, it means that the domain is already used by someone! Just think of something else.

**Need inspiration?**

[Head to the docs](https://docs.letsdisco.dev/) to learn about all the kinds of web projects you can deploy

**And a few important housekeeping notes!**

- As this is a shared community server, please note that everyone (from Recurse) will be able to see the list of repos you chose to manage via that GitHub disco app you set up.
- Emma Smith very aptly said that on this community server, "the walls are made of glass." Don't store / host anything you wouldn't want somebody else to see.
- Lastly, please abide by Recurse Community standards. If you want to build a site to find the best batteries to throw into the ocean, please maybe don't. But if you're hosting something that you would share with other Recursers, then it's all good!! â™¡

{% if found_invite_url %}
1. To setup disco, first install the CLI using the following command (for Linux and macOS):

```bash
curl https://cli-assets.letsdisco.dev/install.sh | sh
```

(if you prefer to install it another way, [head to the docs](https://docs.letsdisco.dev/get-started/install-the-cli))

2. Then, run the following command to join the community server:

<pre>
disco invite:accept {{ found_invite_url }}
</pre>

(<a href="javascript:;" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('disco invite:accept {{ found_invite_url }}'); this.innerHTML='copied!'">click here to copy the command!</a>)

3. Once you've done these steps, **reload this page**!
